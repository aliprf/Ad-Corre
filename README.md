## Introduction



## Ad-Corre Loss



## Evaluation and Samples
The following samples are taken from the paper:

![Samples](https://github.com/aliprf/Ad-Corre/blob/main/paper_graphical_items/samples.jpg?raw=true)


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Installing the requirements
In order to run the code you need to install python >= 3.5. 
The requirements and the libraries needed to run the code can be installed using the following command:

```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Using the pre-trained models
The pretrained models for Affectnet, RafDB, and Fer2013 are provided in the [Trained_Models](https://github.com/aliprf/Ad-Corre/tree/main/Trained_Models) folder. You can use the following code to predict the facial emotionn of a facial image:
  
```

```


## Training Network from scratch


### Preparing Data
Data needs to be normalized and saved in npy format. 


### Training 
The training implementation is located in train.py class. You can use the following code to start the training:

```

```
